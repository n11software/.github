# Code of Conduct
As members of the N11 community, we'd like to make our community a safe, healthy, and welcoming one to join, and we'd like to keep it that way while keeping it as carefree as possible.
## Standards
When interacting in any of our chats or social media platforms (such as Discord), we'd like you to follow a few rules.
 - No spamming
 - No racism, sexism, or any type of harrassment
 - No politics, we'd like to keep our space clean of any politics
 - While cursing is allowed, we draw the line at using words extreme in vulgarity.


## Enforcement
The rules that were set above will be enforced in the said platform by the owners of N11. The owners and a team of moderators are responsible for enforcing these rules, and they will also execute just punishments to those that have violated them.
