This article will show you how and where to find help if you are having any trouble with our softwares.

## Questions
If you need any sort of help, you can rely on your fellow community members, and if the problem persists, you can resort to the owners of N11. Given that many will likely have the same problem, expect the queue to be a bit long. To ask good questions will also make our experience much better. Here are a few tips:
 - try to find if a similar question or problem has already been reported or solved
 - when trying to compose a question, please do your best to make it as detailed as possible. This would help us solve the problem more accurately and easily.
 - take your time in asking questions.
